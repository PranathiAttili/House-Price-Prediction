#  House Price Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts **median house prices** using machine learning models based on various housing features. The dataset includes attributes like **location, number of rooms, median income,** and **proximity to the ocean**. The objective is to explore data, visualize trends, and build regression models that can accurately estimate housing prices.

##  Goals

- Explore and clean housing data 🧹
- Perform EDA using graphs and summary stats 
- Build and evaluate regression models like **Linear Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and more
- Measure performance using **RMSE, MAE, and R² scores**

---

##  ML Concepts Used

- Data preprocessing (`null handling`, `encoding`, `scaling`)
- Feature engineering
- Regression modeling (Supervised ML)
- Model evaluation and comparison


---

## 🚀 Tools & Libraries

- Python 
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🏁 Output

At the end, you’ll have a trained model that can predict house prices based on user-defined features.
